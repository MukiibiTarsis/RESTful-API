    "# API Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authentication\n",
    "Authentication verifies the identity of the user making the request, ensuring that the entity is who it claims to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Authentication Methods\n",
    "- **Token-based authentication**: Issues a token (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Token) upon successful login, which is sent with subsequent requests.\n",
    "- **API keys**: A unique identifier sent with each request to authenticate the client.\n",
    "- **OAuth 2.0**: A protocol that allows third-party applications to access user data without exposing credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authorization\n",
    "Authorization determines what actions the authenticated user is allowed to perform, defining access control rules, roles, and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authorization Mechanisms\n",
    "- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns users to roles with predefined permissions to access specific API resources.\n",
    "- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Provides more granular control based on user attributes like location, time, or device.\n",
    "- **Claims-Based Access Control**: Verifies specific claims within a token to determine access levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Validation\n",
    "Ensuring the data being sent to the API is valid and safe from malicious input is critical to protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Data Validation Techniques\n",
    "- **Input Validation**: Checks all incoming data for expected formats, data types, and length to prevent attacks like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n",
    "- **Sanitization**: Removes potentially harmful characters or formatting from user input.\n",
    "- **Data Masking**: Hides sensitive information within data fields before transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for API Security\n",
    "- Implement a sound and scalable authentication and authorization model.\n",
    "- Use verified industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.\n",
    "- Enforce strong password policies (uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).\n",
    "- Validate and sanitize all input received from clients to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks.\n",
    "- Use allow list-based validation to define strict input formats for endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
